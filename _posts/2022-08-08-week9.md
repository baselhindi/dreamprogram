title: Week 9 (Aug 8 - Aug 12)
---

This week we ran our code on all datasets (many samples from tennis videos) to highlight any lingering issues. We selected video samples that showed our system performing on a range of tennis match scenarios (some male players, female players, historical matches, grass courts, synthetic courts, clay courts, etc). After sifting through all the output videos, we had our sample videos ready for the user studies with BLV people. We then prepared our schedules to conduct our user studies. I decided to play a supplementary role in the first two days of user studies, and then lead user study sessions for the third, fourth, and fifth days. Iâ€™m excited to see the perspective of BLV people and understand if our system is truly adding value for tennis game awareness and understanding!
