This week I was introduced to the CEAL members and the ongoing lab projects through an all-hands meeting. It was eye-opening to see the different applications of HCI and CV for improving low-vision and blind accessibility to technology, information, and transportation. Although Dr. Smith and I had previously discussed which project I would be spending the summer working on, I was excited to hear more about each project from the students who lead each respective project.
