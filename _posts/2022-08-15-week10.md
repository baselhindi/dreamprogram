title: Week 10 (Aug 15 - Aug 19)
---

This week was our user study week, in which we conducted interviews and demonstrations remotely to BLV people across the globe. The schedule was made to accommodate our participants, and so, we had user studies distributed throughout all times of the day and night.  We had a full schedule, and so all members of the team supported the effort to ensure that user studies go smoothly. Each user study has two critical members from the teamâ€™s side: the user-study leader and the note-taker. The leader must ask the questions, interpret the answers, and ensure that the technical setup is working correctly given the hardware of the other person. The note-taker must listen intently for answers and quotes that are poignant, and note the timestamp so that the team can review those timestamps at a later time. This was a huge learning experience for me, as I had never conducted user studies before. It was eye opening to see the reactions of our participants and learn that our system truly added value and allowed BLV people to engage with tennis games! It was also fantastic learning about potential improvement areas through the perspective of our participants. Our user studies went smoothly, and we even managed to schedule a few more for next week!
