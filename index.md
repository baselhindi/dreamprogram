## About Me

Welcome to my homepage! My name is Basel Hindi, and I am pursuing a Master’s degree in computer science at Columbia University. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and human-computer interaction, and the usage of these tools for improving accessibility.

I graduated in 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I then worked in industry for three years doing autonomous vehicle R&D. Throughout my time in industry, I developed a passion for CS, and more specifically, for computer vision and artificial intelligence. The CS@CU MS Bridge program offered me a unique opportunity to transition into the world of graduate level CS by first providing the necessary coursework for non-CS undergrads.

## About My Project

Sports Accessibility from Pixels: Enhancing gameplay understanding of tennis for blind and visually impaired people using an immersive audio design. This project utilizes a computer vision architecture to dissect the components of a broadcasted tennis video including the court, players, and ball, and then converts those components to a digestible spatialized audio for blind and low-vision users.
