## About Me

Welcome to my homepage! My name is Basel Hindi, and I am pursuing a Master’s degree in computer science at Columbia University. My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and human-computer interaction, and the usage of these tools for improving accessibility.

I graduated in 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I then worked in industry for three years doing autonomous vehicle R&D. Throughout my time in industry, I developed a passion for CS, and more specifically, for computer vision and artificial intelligence. The CS@CU MS Bridge program offered me a unique opportunity to transition into the world of graduate level CS by first providing the necessary coursework for non-CS undergrads.

## About My Project

Sports Accessibility from Pixels: This project is lead by Ph.D. student Gaurav Jain, and it aims to enhance gameplay understanding of tennis for blind and visually impaired people using an immersive audio design. This work utilizes a computer vision architecture to dissect the components of a broadcasted tennis video including the court, players, and ball, and then converts those components to a digestible spatialized audio for blind and low-vision users.
